# OCR-using-Yolo
In this project i will use YOLO object detection to train a model to detect Egyptian license plates from images and videos. Egyptian license plates have a unique format that makes them identifiable, with the car's character  written in Arabic  and a series of numbers on the bottom. By training YOLO on a large dataset of labeled Egyptian license plate images, I will build a model that can accurately locate license plates within complex scenes.

Once the YOLO model is trained, I will use it to detect license plates from new, unlabeled images and videos. YOLO will output the coordinates of any detected license plates regions. I will then programmatically crop out just those regions from the original images/frames. This will give me sub-images containing only the license plate contents, with the background removed.

At that point, I plan to use EasyOCR to recognize the text within each license plate crop. EasyOCR is an optical character recognition tool that is well-suited for Arabic script. By feeding it the license plate crops, it should be able to read both the Arabic name on top and the numbers on the bottom. This will give me the full text contents of each detected license plate.
